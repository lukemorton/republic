# Republic

A batteries-included web framework designed for human-led, AI-assisted development.

Republic accepts a simple reality: modern software is no longer written once and maintained by hand. It is continuously generated, refactored, upgraded, and deployed with the help of AI. Republic is built to make that collaboration reliable, understandable, and sustainable for humans.

## Human-first, AI-aware

Republic is for people who want better leverage from AI. Humans remain responsible for intent, architecture, and behaviour. AI helps implement, maintain, and evolve those decisions safely.

The framework is designed so that both humans and AI work against the same structured interface. No guessing project layouts. No fragile code edits. No magic conventions that only exist in someone's head.

## The Constitution

At the centre of every Republic app is the Constitution: a declarative specification that describes the system as a whole. Models, routes, authentication, background jobs, mailers, cloud targets, and feature behaviour all live here.

The Constitution is the single source of truth. Code, infrastructure, and deployments are derived from it. Because the structure is explicit and compact, it can be read, edited, and reasoned about by humans and AI alike.

## Tool-driven development

Republic is built around tools, not ad-hoc CLI commands. Each tool performs a specific, well-defined operation: add a model, define a route, override an implementation, deploy to a cloud target, or inspect the current system state.

The CLI is just one interface over these tools. AI environments such as Claude Code can call the same tools directly via plugins. This makes AI assistance predictable and safe, because every change flows through the same structured pipeline.

## Batteries included, escape hatches guaranteed

Republic aims for Rails-level productivity out of the box: routing, persistence, authentication, background jobs, mailers, configuration, and deployment are all first-class.

At the same time, nothing is locked in. Any generated component can be replaced with a user-authored implementation and explicitly wired into the Constitution. This "escape hatch" model lets teams drop down to custom code when needed, without breaking regeneration or upgrades.

Opinionated by default, flexible by design.

## Cloud-native, not runtime-bound

Republic does not stop at emitting code for a single language runtime. Because the Constitution is language-agnostic, Republic can generate traditional applications or emit directly to managed cloud targets such as serverless platforms and edge environments.

This allows teams to think in terms of systems and features, not deployment plumbing.

## Built for change

Upgrades and new features are where Republic shines. Because the structure of the app is explicit, AI can help keep projects up to date: migrating schemas, adopting new framework capabilities, and applying best practices automatically.

Feature specifications and acceptance criteria, expressed in a structured, BDD-style format, help humans communicate intent clearly and give AI a reliable guide for implementation.

## The idea

Republic treats software as something to be governed, not just written. Humans define policy and behaviour. Tools and AI carry out the work. The Constitution keeps everything coherent over time.

It feels familiar, productive, and pragmatic — like Rails — but is built for the reality of modern, AI-augmented development teams.
